# Welcome to this webpage!

Here I will be running a demo webpage for my CS-HU 250 course on Version Control.

## Notes

- Markdown seems to be very picky about line spacing. Getting it to render right in the preview tab is a bit challenging.
- This website is using the supported theme called Cayman.

### Here is a cat's game of tic-tac-toe in a table:

| Tic | Tac | Toe |
|-----|-----|-----|
| X   | X   | O   |
| O   | O   | X   |
| X   | O   | X   |
